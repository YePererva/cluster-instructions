# Creating distro template

Basically, this is an installation of OS with a set of software needed at every computer in cluster. Here, the choice of OS is [Fedora Server](https://getfedora.org/en/server/) with additional GUI ([GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/)). The GUI will be installed, but turned off by default.

At the moment of writing this tutorial, the latest version of Fedora was 32, but I decided to go with Fedora 33 beta, since its release already [announced](https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-the-release-of-fedora-33-beta/).

I prefer to perform this part on computer, which later will be used as computing node, but it doesn't matter much.

## Important remark
I prefer to use Fedora Live workstation as live media, but install the Server version. Such media:
- Has wider range of drivers
- allows to wipe computer disks using `shred` [command](https://linux.die.net/man/1/shred)

## 00. Installation of OS and tweaking
Install Fedora as minimal Server environment without GUI (hopefully, one day Fedora add option as Server with GUI as CentOS did). If any updates / downloads are needed : use Ethernet!

For a sake of example, assuming the following:
- username : `i_am_the_user`
- computer name: `clusterhead`
- allow autologin on boot (just for convenience during the set-up)

**NB! :** Not yet tested if the `root` account should be locked

### 00.1. Install GUI

#### 00.1.a: GNOME
For [GNOME](https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=Fedora_31&p=desktop&f=1)
```
sudo -i
dnf -y group install GNOME
```

**OPTIONAL:** If want to use a "Classic GNOME", create the `~/.xinitrc` with content:

```
export XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME-Classic:GNOME
export GNOME_SHELL_SESSION_MODE=classic
exec /usr/bin/gnome-session --session=gnome-classic
```

To start the GNOME session:
```
startx
```

GNOME environment is installed together with extra built-in software, which is not needed. To purge it, run:
```
sudo -i
dnf remove -y cheese gnome-weather gnome-photos tracker-miners gnome-initial-setup gnome-getting-started-docs yelp
```

For more info, check [this thread on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/assir9/thinking_of_lobotomizing_gnome_what_do_you_think/)

## 00.2. Password-less `sudo` for user [Not Recommended!]
Navigate to folder `/etc/sudoers.d/` via `cd`, create with `sudo` any file without extension (!!!) in this folder (let say, `00-users-policy`) with the following content:
```
i_am_the_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

**NB! :** The order of the rules is important. If any other file with leading numbers are present, use filename with numbers to make sure that your file is the last one to execute.

**NB! :** Be careful, if any typo is made like `i_am_the_user (ALL)=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL` it can lead to inaccessibility of `root` at all! Can be fixed if booted from live media and accessed this file from there.

Can be also done as one liner:
```
sudo -i
echo 'i_am_the_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' > '/etc/sudoers.d/00-users-policy'
```



## 01. Managing updates

### Manual full update
```
sudo dnf upgrade --refresh -y && sudo reboot
```
Reboot is optional, but recommended due to the fact that it can install fresh kernel an we want OS to run on the freshest kernel.

**NB! :** Manually upgrading from image of an old distro:
```
sudo -i
dnf -y upgrade --refresh
dnf -y install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade
dnf -y system-upgrade download --releasever=32 # or whatever is the freshest at your time
dnf system-upgrade reboot
```

### Limit number of stored kernels during updates
If there is update of kernel, you may want to limit amount of kernels to be stored after update:
`sudo nano /etc/dnf/dnf.conf`
Find line `installonly_limit` and set it as 2:
`installonly_limit=2`

It will keep the latest installed kernel and the one, which was previously on this machine. In case if there are already more than 2 kernels installed, you can purge them with command:
```
sudo dnf remove -y $(dnf repoquery --installonly --latest-limit=-2 -q)
```
Or, if you want to purge all previous kernels:
```
sudo dnf remove -y $(dnf repoquery --installonly --latest-limit=-1 -q)
```

### Auto-updates via `dnf-automatic`
Read [documentation](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/AutoUpdates) to figure out if you need it!

Install `dnf-automatic` package:
```
sudo dnf install dnf-automatic
```
And edit settings file, located at `/etc/dnf/automatic.conf`. Find following parameters in section `[commands]`:
- `upgrade_type`
- `download_updates`
- `apply_updates`

Set those as follow:
```
upgrade_type=default
download_updates=yes
apply_updates=yes
```
And enable these setting as system service:
```
sudo systemctl enable --now dnf-automatic.timer
```
This should install all needed updates / upgrades, but some of them may require a reboot of system to apply.

#### Auto-purge previous kernels
Add following line to `/etc/crontab` to purge all old kernels:
```
0 0 * * * root dnf remove -y $(dnf repoquery --installonly --latest-limit=-1 -q)
```
It will be run every midnight. Periodical reboot may be required.

**NB! :** Sometimes, attempt to remove old kernels via `dnf remove -y $(dnf repoquery --installonly --latest-limit=-1 -q)` may raise the error:
```
Error:
 Problem: The operation would result in removing the following protected packages: kernel-core
(try to add '--skip-broken' to skip uninstallable packages)
```
It means, that there are updates/upgrade of kernels installed, but system is running on older version of kernel and reboot is required to run fresh kernel. This is why periodical reboot is recommended.

**NB! :** If want to adjust time for `crontab` task, [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) may be handy.

**NB! :** If needed, list all available timers with `sudo systemctl list-timers`

## 02. Editing `ssh` settings

If remote authentication with password will be involved: edit either `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-redhat.conf` or `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file. Find lines and edit:
```
PermitEmptyPasswords no
PasswordAuthentication yes
RSAAuthentication yes
PubkeyAuthentication yes
# If you want to prohibit root authentication (line ~47):
PermitRootLogin no
```

### Add `ssh` and `cockpit` to auto-start and firewall exceptions
```
sudo -i
# for ssh access
systemctl enable sshd
firewall-cmd --add-service=ssh --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-port=9090/tcp --permanent
```
### Password-less communication between nodes
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chmod 700 ~/.ssh/
sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

## 03. Shared software

### Useful software

```
# Related to programming languages
sudo dnf install -y gcc gcc-c++ clang nasm gcc-fortran python3 R julia golang haskell-platform java-latest-openjdk ruby nodejs npm
# Or even

### Installing `modules` environment
[Documentation](https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/cea-hpc/modules) | [Web-site](http://modules.sourceforge.net/)

Lately, should be available for installation via:
```
sudo dnf install environment-modules -y
```
If that doesn't work, go to manual installation:
```
cd
# download
git clone https://github.com/cea-hpc/modules
cd ./modules && pwd
# install prerequisites
sudo dnf install -y autoconf gettext-devel gettext-autopoint tcl-devel dejagnu sphinx libjpeg-devel mesa-libGL-devel libtool-ltdl-devel
# install
./configure
make
sudo make install
# purge installer
cd
sudo rm -rf ~/modules
```

Good [explanation](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/shared/modules) about why and how to use `modules`. [Explanation](https://docs.hpc.qmul.ac.uk/using/UsingModules/) how to use set-up software to use with `modules`.

## Installation SLURM / MUNGE

[Niflheim Slurm](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/niflheim/SLURM) - [Nilfheim](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/niflheim/niflheim) - [SLURM official](https://www.schedmd.com/) - [MOC](https://moc-documents.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hpc/Slurm.html) - [University of South Florida](https://wiki.rc.usf.edu/index.php/Guide_to_SLURM)

SLURM and MUNGE require consistent UID and GID across every node in the cluster.
That's why SLURM / MUNGE should be either:
-  installed on distro template
  ```
  sudo dnf -y install munge munge-libs munge-devel slurm slurm-perlapi slurm-slurmd slurm-slurmctld slurm-torque
  ```
- Created a same and dedicated users group on each node
  ```
  export MUNGEUSER=1022
  sudo groupadd -g $MUNGEUSER munge
  sudo useradd -m -c "MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium" -d /var/lib/munge -u $MUNGEUSER -g munge -s /sbin/nologin munge
  export SlurmUSER=1023
  sudo groupadd -g $SlurmUSER slurm
  sudo useradd -m -c "Slurm workload manager" -d /var/lib/slurm -u $SlurmUSER -g slurm -s /bin/bash slurm
  ```
- Read the group number for SLURM and Munge users on existing nodes and create same on others
  How to see, what groups are already existing:
  ```
   id -u slurm
   id -u munge
  ```
  It will return all existing UIDs.

Create the key file and add some restrictions:
```
sudo /usr/sbin/create-munge-key -r
# you can copy it to /storage
# cp /etc/munge/munge.key /storage/munge.key
# if copying from /storage on target node
# sudo cp /storage/munge.key /etc/munge/munge.key
sudo chown munge /etc/munge/munge.key
sudo chmod 0400 /etc/munge/munge.key
sudo chown -R munge: /etc/munge/ /var/log/munge/
sudo chmod 0700 /etc/munge/ /var/log/munge/
```
Without restrictions it will fail to start (`munged: Error: Keyfile is insecure: "/etc/munge/munge.key"`).
Now enable and start munge
```
sudo systemctl start munge
sudo systemctl status munge
sudo systemctl enable munge
```

### If need to remove installation
```
sudo dnf -y remove munge munge-libs munge-devel slurm slurm-perlapi slurm-slurmd slurm-slurmctld slurm-torque
sudo userdel -r munge
sudo userdel -r slurm
sudo groupdel munge
sudo groupdel slurm
```

### Add SLURM and MUNGE to firewall exceptions:

```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port={6817,6818,6819,7321}/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port={6817,6818,6819,7321}/udp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

**NB! :** Sometimes, it is needed to use:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=internal --add-port={6817,6818,6819,7321}/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=internal --add-port={6817,6818,6819,7321}/udp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

**NB! :** In rare cases, need to use:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT_direct 0 -s 10.42.42.0/24 -j ACCEPT
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

## 7. Folders for further shared use
```
sudo mkdir /storage
sudo mkdir /storage/shared
sudo mkdir /storage/local
sudo chown -R nobody /storage
sudo chmod -R 777 /storage
```

## -2. Modification if used desktop environment (Gnome)

## Disable sleep, enable auto-lock
Options: [1](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/disabling-automatic-screenlock/) or [2](https://ostechnix.com/linux-tips-disable-suspend-and-hibernation/)

```
sudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target
```
The output should be alike:
```
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/sleep.target → /dev/null.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/suspend.target → /dev/null.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/hibernate.target → /dev/null.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/hybrid-sleep.target → /dev/null.
```

**P.S.:** May want to consider use [Caffeine](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/517/caffeine/). Applicable only for GNOME desktop environment

### Tweaking the Firefox
Nice guide [here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-browsing-search-download-history-firefox#:~:text=Select%20the%20Privacy%20%26%20Security%20panel,Clear%20history%20when%20Firefox%20closes).

1. Menu -> `Preferences` -> `Privacy and Security` and go to `History Section`
There will be a drop-down menu near `Firefox will` and select `Use custom settings for history`
2. Check the `Clear history when Firefox closes` and click `Settings` button (located to the right from it)
3. In `Settings for Clearing History` check everything, what is supposed to be cleaned
4. Click `OK` and close the Firefox
5. `Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed`

Additionally, consider adding such ad blockers as  [`AdGuard`](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adguard-adblocker/) or [`AdBlocker Ultimate`](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/adblocker-ultimate/?src=collection&collection_id=314d7111-6e17-485e-9946-315cb2f477e7)

- If need to remove and replace with other browser: `sudo dnf remove -y firefox`
- If used server variation of Fedora, `firefox` is not installed by default, install it as `sudo dnf install -y firefox`

### Installation and Tweaking the Chromium

```
sudo dnf install -y chromium
```

Prevent tracking the history:
```
chmod 0444 ~/.config/chromium/Default/History
```

Or, enable incognito mode by default:
```
sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser
```
and select `/usr/bin/chromium-browser`. This will make Chromium your system's default browser.

Run `sudo -e /etc/chromium-browser/default` (edit as root), and change the line that reads `CHROMIUM_FLAGS=""` to `CHROMIUM_FLAGS="--incognito"`.

Additionally, consider adding such ad blockers as  [`AdGuard`](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adguard-adblocker/bgnkhhnnamicmpeenaelnjfhikgbkllg?hl=en) or [`AdBlocker Ultimate`](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblocker-ultimate/ohahllgiabjaoigichmmfljhkcfikeof?hl=en)

### Installation of [Sublime Text 3 Stable](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/linux_repositories.html)
```
sudo rpm -v --import https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-rpm-pub.gpg
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.sublimetext.com/rpm/stable/x86_64/sublime-text.repo
sudo dnf install -y sublime-text
```

## -1. Preparation for back-up
Before copying the distro, to clean the command history, run to clean root history:
```
sudo -i
history -c
exit
```
Run to clean `i_am_the_user` user history:
```
history -c && sudo poweroff
```
