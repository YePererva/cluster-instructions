# Creating the copy of distro template

Depends on what is available. I prefer to use `clonezilla` and either:
- plug SSD of larger volume as a separate drive to machine and use `disk-to-image` [mode](https://clonezilla.org/show-live-doc-content.php?topic=clonezilla-live/doc/01_Save_disk_image)
- plug the same size HDD / SSD as a separate drive to machine and use `disk-to-disk` [mode](https://clonezilla.org/show-live-doc-content.php?topic=clonezilla-live/doc/03_Disk_to_disk_clone)

**NB! :** It is possible to use an external SSD or HDD connected via USB, but not all computers/servers (especially, the old ones) can provide enough power to power up large external drive.
