# Set up the Managing node

At this point assemble the managing node, router and storage node.
Power up managing node only (for now).

**Reminder:** This node should have a possibility to use a discrete video card. Not each server can allow that:
- HP ProLiant DL165 G5 : can't
- Dell System PowerEdge R415: can

## Fix the networks
`Nodes 1...X` may need the Internet access for updates / software installation / data acquisition. We need to:
- allow IP forwarding
- define rules for forwarding
- rise the DNS server
- rise DHCP server
- make firewall to allow required services
- enable auto-start of services at boot-up of system

### Get the names of interfaces (WiFi + Ethernet)
Run in terminal: `ip a`

In scope of this example we assume following:
- Node 0 has 2 interfaces:
    - `wls1` : for internet access
      - it has `00:23:14:e3:8e:68` as MAC address
      - will be connected to work / home / university network
    - `eno1` : for cluster network
      - has `88:ae:1d:ae:e2:da` as MAC address
- We want our cluster to have:
    - Node 0 to have IP : `10.42.42.1`
    - All other nodes would have IPs : `10.42.42.x` (some number in the end)
    - Netmask : `255.255.255.0`

#### Wireless connection with `nmcli`
```
nmcli radio wifi on     # turn on wifi
nmcli device wifi list  # list all available networks
nmcli device wifi connect <SSID|BSSID> password <password>
```

If your network required authentication by MAC address without password:
- get MAC address of your device with `ip a` command
- add your MAC address to allowed devices of your network (method may vary)
- connect to network with `nmcli device wifi connect <SSID|BSSID>`


### Ethernet to Ethernet

With `ip a` find the names of network interfaces. Here, assuming:
- `enp2s2f0` with MAC-address `00:23:7d:5e:cf:2c` - outer connection
- `enp2s2f1` with MAC-address `00:23:7d:5e:cf:2d` - inner connection

### IP forwarding

Some nice tutorials: [1](http://techninotes.blogspot.com/2018/10/creating-fedora-28-server-linux-router.html), [2](http://techninotes.blogspot.com/2018/10/creating-fedora-28-server-linux-router_31.html) and [3](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/rhel-fedora-centos-setup-routing-metric-networkdevice/)

Edit `/etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf` and add `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` in the end of that file. This will allow forwarding after reboot, but for testing you need it right now:
```
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

### Define firewall network zones:
Assign default zone as external:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --set-default-zone external
```
and verify it with `sudo firewall-cmd --get-default-zone`. It should return `external`.

Assign the `eno1` to internal zone:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=internal --change-interface eno1
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=external --change-interface wls1
```

In ethernet-to ethernet case:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=internal --change-interface enp2s2f1
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=external --change-interface enp2s2f0
```

Check all assigned zones with:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
```
It should return something like:
```
    external
        interfaces: wls1
    internal
        interfaces: eno1
```
Allow all traffic on the internal zone:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --set-target=ACCEPT
```
Set up masquerading on the external interface to allow IPv4 routing
```
sudo -i
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 nat POSTROUTING 0 -o wls1 -j MASQUERADE
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter FORWARD 0 -i eno1 -o wls1 -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter FORWARD 0 -i wls1 -o eno1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --reload
```

In case of Ethernet to Ethernet:
Set up masquerading on the external interface to allow IPv4 routing
```
sudo -i
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 nat POSTROUTING 0 -o enp2s2f0 -j MASQUERADE
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter FORWARD 0 -i enp2s2f1 -o enp2s2f0 -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter FORWARD 0 -i enp2s2f0 -o enp2s2f1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --reload
```

### Fix auto-selecting network

In most cased, if you have simultaneously working Wi-Fi (!) and the Ethernet interfaces, operating system prefers to access internet over the Ethernet. And, since it is the internal network, there is no actual internet connection.

Thus we need to make sure that OS will be not looking for internet on ethernet.

Create `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp2s2f1` as root and edit/add following lines:
```
TYPE=ETHERNET
NAME=enp2s2f1
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=none
IPADDR=10.42.42.1
GATEWAY=10.42.42.1
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
DEFROUTE=no
IPV6_DEFROUTE=no
IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=no
DEVICE=enp2s2f1
```

And restart NetworkManager via running `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager`.
The `DEFROUTE=no` will prevent managing node to look for outer network at this interface.

#### In case of use Fedora 32
Edit `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eno1` as root and edit/add following lines:
```
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=none
IPADDR=10.42.42.1
GATEWAY=10.42.42.1
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
DEFROUTE=no
IPV6_DEFROUTE=no
```

### Set-up DNS Server

`sudo dnf -y install bind bind-utils`

Open `sudo vi /etc/named.conf` and (make sure to have `;` in the end of each edited / added line):
- find line `listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; };`
- change it to `listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 10.42.42.1; };` or ` listen-on port 53 { any; };` or `listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 10.42.42.0/24; };`
- find line `allow-query     { localhost; };`
- change it to `allow-query { localhost; 10.42.42.0/24; };`
- right after it add line `allow-recursion { localhost; 10.42.42.0/24; };`
- right after it add line `allow-transfer { localhost; 10.42.42.0/24; };`
- define DNS via adding line after it: `forwarders { 8.8.8.8; 8.8.4.4; };`
- find line `recursion yes;` and add line after it: `forward only;`

**NB! :** line `forwarders { 8.8.8.8; 8.8.4.4; };` defines DNS service you will be using by default.

If you need extra security layer against fishing/malware/advertisement/ not safe for work content, consider specifying another DNS provider!
Some options can be found
[here](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/upstream-dns-providers/),
[here](https://alternate-dns.com/),
[here](https://www.epsiloneight.com/private-dns)
or [here](https://www.lifewire.com/free-and-public-dns-servers-2626062)

Open `sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/named`
    - add `OPTIONS="-4"` in the end of file

```
systemctl start named
systemctl status named
systemctl enable named
```

```
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=dns --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### Set-up DHCP server

Install DHCP server software
```
dnf install -y dhcp
```

Edit `sudo vi /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` as root:
```
authoritative;
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;
log-facility local7;

subnet 10.42.42.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    interface enp2s2f1;

    option routers 10.42.42.1;
    option domain-name-servers 10.42.42.1;
    range 10.42.42.10 10.42.42.255;
}    
```

Enable and start DHCP server service
```
sudo systemctl start dhcpd
sudo systemctl status dhcpd
sudo systemctl enable dhcpd
```

### Make firewall to allow required services
```
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=dhcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### network test:

Boot-up the storage node and router. Wait till storage node boots up.
From main node run:
```
sudo arp-scan --interface=enp0s25 --localnet
# or
sudo arp-scan --interface=enp2s2f1 --localnet
```
It should return something like this:
```
Interface: enp2s2f1, type: EN10MB, MAC: 00:23:7d:5e:cf:2d, IPv4: 10.42.42.1
Starting arp-scan 1.9.7 with 256 hosts (https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan)
10.42.42.10     00:23:7d:5e:e1:9c       Hewlett Packard

1 packets received by filter, 0 packets dropped by kernel
Ending arp-scan 1.9.7: 256 hosts scanned in 2.058 seconds (124.39 hosts/sec). 1 responded
```

If nothing found: there are problems.

**NB! :** If power-up storage node before-set-up the network, it will not assign the IP address for it till next boot.

## 2. Preparing the shared storage

## 2(a). Using the a dedicated storage node with FreeNAS

Assuming, that we got previously mentioned output from `arp-scan`:
```
10.42.42.10     00:23:7d:5e:e1:9c       Dell
```
### Assign the static IP for storage node

TO do this, on main node, we need to edit `etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` file and insert to network definition piece like this:
```
host node_X {
    hardware ethernet `MAC_ADDRESS_of_node_X`;
    fixed-address 10.42.42.X;
}
```
Let's assign 10.42.42.2 address to this node:
```
host storage_node {
    hardware ethernet 00:23:7d:5e:e1:9c;
    fixed-address 10.42.42.2;
}
```
**NB! :** Don't place `;` after `}`

Wait a bit, till changes take affect. Monitor changes with `sudo arp-scan --interface=enp2s2f1 --localnet`.

### Go with browser to declared IP
Login with `root` and defined password

### Create a "pool"

`Storage` -> `Pools` -> `Add` -> select drive
Add name to pool `clusterfs` -> Create

it will be created as `/mnt/clusterfs`

### Share
`Sharing` -> `Unix Share (NFS)` -> Allowed Networks : `10.42.42.0/24`

### Create a user
`Accounts`:
- make user:
  - same name as on other nodes
  - same password as on other nodes
- add permissions to write to the `/mnt/clusterfs`

### Check if mountable
```
sudo mount 10.42.42.2:/mnt/clusterfs /storage/shared
cd /storage/shared
# This will create 100 folders in /storage/shared
for i in `seq -f "%04g" 1 100` ; do mkdir ./TempFolder_$i; done
```

Now go again to web-interface of `FreeNas`, switch to `Shell` and check if those folder were created there:
```
ls -l /mnt/clusterfs
```

If everything is OK, set-up the automount of shared folder on managing node via editing `/etc/fstab`:
```
10.42.42.2:/mnt/clusterfs    /storage/shared    nfs    auto,nofail,noatime,nolock,intr,tcp,actimeo=1800   0 0
```

**NB! :** For some reason, this set-up fails if computing node starts before managing node. Re-connect doesn't work. Need to reboot computing node after the managing node is started. Alternatively, consider use crontab for periodical reconnect:
`sudo vi /etc/crontab` and add line:
```
*/5 * * * * root /bin/mount -a
```

## 2(b). Using a separate HDD / SSD from main node

### Prepare the separate HDD / SSD for NFS share

Install the second HDD/SSD or other disk, which is needed to share as storage across all nodes.

Find the needed one with `sudo fdisk -l` or `sudo lsblk`. Assuming the target is `/dev/sdb`.

### Deleting all partitions
- Type `sudo fdisk /dev/sdb`
- Type `d` to proceed to delete a partition
- Type `1` to select the 1st partition and press `Enter`. If disk contains only one partition it will be deleted instantly at `d`
- Repeat deletion for other partitions on disk

### Creating a partition
```
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
```
- Type `n` to create a new partition
- Type `p` to indicate a primary partition
- Press `ENTER` to accept the default partition number
- Press `ENTER` to accept the default starting sector
- Press `ENTER` to accept the default ending sector
  - There could be message:
  ```
  Partition #1 contains a *** signature.

  Do you want to remove the signature? [Y]es/[N]o:
  ```
  Confirm deletion and proceed
- Type `p` again to print a list of partitions
- If everything is correct, `w` to write the change.

This will create a partition `/dev/sdb1`. Now, create the file system there (may need to unmount it first: `sudo umount /dev/sdb1`):
- for ext4 : `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1`
- for ntfs : `sudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/sdb1`
    NB! : requires `sudo dnf install -y ntfs-3g`
- for FAT32 : `sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1`
    NB! : Don't use this. Not suitable for files > 4 GB

### Automatic mounting of after each reboot
- check mounting of `sdb1` to `/storage`:
  ```
  sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /storage
  df -hT
  ```
- set automount with `/etc/fstab`:
  - with partition label `/dev/sdb1`
      - for ext4 filesystem:
    ```
    /dev/sdb1 /storage  ext4  defaults  0 0
    ```
      - for ntfs:
    ```
    /dev/sdb1 /storage  ntfs  defaults  0 0
    ```
  - with drive ID. Obtain it with `sudo blkid`
    NB! Without `sudo` not always show the mounted USB drives.
    Output should looks like:
    ```
    /dev/sdb1: UUID="16a7e9b6-896e-4c48-8172-3d89b8472830" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="16dae6bc-01"
    ```
    The target is `UUID="16a7e9b6-896e-4c48-8172-3d89b8472830"`.
    ```
    UUID=16a7e9b6-896e-4c48-8172-3d89b8472830 /storage  ext4  defaults  0 0
    ```
    for ntfs:
    ```
    UUID=16a7e9b6-896e-4c48-8172-3d89b8472830 /storage  ntfs  defaults  0 0
    ```

For some reason, I lost a permission to write into `/storage` folder, needed to reassign it:
```
sudo chown -R nobody.nogroup /storage
sudo chmod -R 777 /storage
```

### Setting the NFS share
Edit file `/etc/exports` to add the storage based on template:
`path_to_share_folder IP_address_of_Node_0/Netmask(parameters)`

In our case:
`/storage 10.42.42.0/24(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)`

Now start and enable auto-start of NFS services:
```
sudo systemctl start rpcbind nfs-server
sudo systemctl status rpcbind nfs-server
sudo systemctl enable rpcbind nfs-server
```

Add those services to firewall exceptions:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service={nfs,mountd,rpc-bind} --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

You can always check, what is allowed via running:
```
firewall-cmd --list-services
```

**NB! :** For Linux environment - don't used SMB for sharing files between nodes. It is [slower](https://ferhatakgun.com/network-share-performance-differences-between-nfs-smb/). SAMBA (SMB) still can be usable to have access  to files from Windows.


## -4. Change default ssh port
Edit file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Find line `#Port 22` and either edit it or just add line ine the end:
```
Port 22122
```
Where `22122` is the port you want to use. And add this port to firewall exceptions
```
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=22122/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

## -3. Set graphical mode as default
Run:
```
sudo systemctl set-default runlevel5.target
```
or
```
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
```

## -2. Set remote graphical environment:

### a: XRDP [Not properly working as of now]

```
sudo dnf -y install xrdp tigervnc-server
sudo systemctl enable --now xrdp
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=3389/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

Now, can be connected from Windows RDP.

**Remark:** I encountered issue, when I was able to connect, but not control the machine, since it asked me to enter password over and over again.

### b: VNC
```
# Install
sudo dnf -y install tigervnc-server
# add to firewall exceptions
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=vnc-server --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
# add password
vncpasswd
# Initialize the screen
sudo vncserver :1 -geometry 1024x768
```

Can be connected via [OpenVNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/).

## -1. Password-less connection with SSH + RSA from outer network to managing node

### Single user
If on Windows : install any Linux for Windows and run `bash`
- Generate own key for connection
  `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`
- Copy ID to management node:
  ```
  ssh-copy-id scientist@10.42.42.1
  ```
  or, if `ssh` port was changed:
  ```
  ssh-copy-id scientist@10.42.42.1 -p port_number
  ```
This way conflicts with previously assigned permissions.

### Multi-user
- Generate own key for connection
  ```
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
  ```
- Copy your `id_rsa.pub` or any other pubkey file to the host with [SCP](https://haydenjames.io/linux-securely-copy-files-using-scp/):
  ```
  scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub scientist@IP_ADDRESS:~/.ssh/mykey.pub
  ```

  **NB! :** Sometimes may require to strictly indicate the location of file on the current machine without use of `~`

  **NB! :** If directory `~/.ssh` doesn't exist on target node, ir will result into error `No such file or directory` in sych case prefer to use `rsync`:
  ```
  rsync --rsync-path="mkdir -p ~/.ssh && rsync" ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub scientist@10.42.42.1:"~/.ssh/mykey.pub"
  ```
- Login to host node as normal password authentication
  ```
  ssh scientist@host_IP -p port_number
  ```
- go as root and copy the content of your pubkey file to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
  ```
  sudo -i
  cd /home/scientist/.ssh
  cat ./mykey.pub >> ./authorized_keys
  rm ./mykey.pub
  ```
Another option would be:
```
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh scientist@$host_IP 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
```

### Universal solution
Use the SSH client with possibility to store passwords.
My favourite is [Termius](https://termius.com/), but I also tried [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) and [KiTTY](http://www.9bis.net/kitty/#!index.md).

Also, as file viewer for remote access from Windows, [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) or [FAR manager](https://www.farmanager.com/index.php?l=en) can be used.
