# Prerequisites
Running on compute node!

Install `sch`:
```
sudo dnf install -y csh
```


## Automatic installation Gaussian 16

1. Transfer files of Gaussian Installer to a shared folder.
    Assuming, now it is available as `\storage\shared\Gaussian 16\linux binaries`
2. Navigate to `\storage\shared\Gaussian 16\linux binaries`
3. Copy there attached file `setup-gaussian.sh`
4. Edit `setup.sh`
    Edit script setup.sh to modify 4 variables:
    - `installer_location`:
    defines where the installer is located. If script is placed to installer folder, can be blank, script is able to determine it automatically.
    - `installation_destination`
    determines the folder, where you want Gaussian to be installed. Can be specified as `/` since installer itself creates `g16` subfolder inside of specified folder
    - `scratch_folder`:
    determines the folder for scratches (intermediate calculations storage)
    - `usergroup_name`:
    script creates the group for gaussian users. It helps to make it automatically with defined name
5. Run `setup.sh` the script as:
    ```
    # to add current user to group of Gaussian users
    sudo sh ./setup-gaussian.sh $USER
    # to not add current user to group of Gaussian users
    sudo sh ./setup-gaussian.sh
    ```

Done! Reboot system and you can test set up by typing `g16` in terminal. it should result in something like:
```
Entering Gaussian System, Link 0=g16
```
After that interrupt the execution with `Ctrl+C`. Installation is finished.
