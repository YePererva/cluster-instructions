# Multiply the distros to all nodes

## Reminder : Allow to boot without keyboard attached
This is needed to prevent boot freeze at moment, when the system tries to see keyboards attached to computer.
Usually, it results into `Keyboard failure` errors.

## Reminder : Auto-restart in case of power loss
For a sake of automatic start-up in case of loss of power:
- Make sure to set the property in BIOS / UEFI for each computer to automatically boot on power-restore
- This depends on manufacturer of motherboard
