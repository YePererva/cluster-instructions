# Replacing the managing node

## 1. Make a copy of distro of managing node

## 2. Deploy the copy on new machine
Or, just simply move HDD to a different machine

## 3. Fix the network issues

After reboot/start-up you may encounter network errors: interfaces on new machine have different names.

Here, assuming:
- on the old machine they were:
  - `enp2s2f0` : external
  - `enp2s2f1` : internal
- on the new machine they are:
  - `eno1` : external
  - `eno2` : internal

### 3.1. Re-assign firewall zones
After changing the computer, all new interfaces were added to `external` zone. To confirm it, run `sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones`. Result should looks like:
```
external
  interfaces: eno1 eno2
trusted
  sources: 10.42.42.0/24
```
Now, assign the `eno2` interface to internal zone:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=external --change-interface eno1
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=internal --change-interface eno2
```
Make sure it is properly set `sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones`:
```
external
  interfaces: eno1
internal
  interfaces: eno2
trusted
  sources: 10.42.42.0/24
```
After this: `sudo firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent`

### 3.2. Change the interface for DHCP server
Edit `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`, find the line with previously assigned interface in network declaration and change it to `eno2`
